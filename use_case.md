Based on the design, once you've built the Smart Sorting System, here's what you'll do with it:

## **System Usage Flow:**

**1. INPUT Phase**
- Feed your unsorted data array into the system
- Could be numbers, strings, objects, etc.

**2. SELECTION Phase**
- Choose between Quick Sort or Merge Sort
- System might auto-select based on data characteristics

**3. PROCESSING Phase**
- Watch the algorithm execute its divide-and-conquer strategy
- System performs the sorting operations

**4. ANALYSIS Phase**
- **Performance Analyzer** tracks:
  - Time taken to sort
  - Number of comparisons made
  - Memory consumption

**5. OUTPUT Phase**
- Receive your **sorted data array**
- Get a **Comparison Report** showing:
  - Which algorithm was faster
  - Efficiency metrics
  - Speed comparison
  - Stability analysis

**6. DECISION MAKING**
- Use the comparison report to understand which algorithm works best for your data type
- Make informed choices for future sorting needs
- Optimize your applications based on performance insights

## **End Goal:**
You'll have both:
- ✅ **Sorted data** (the practical output)
- ✅ **Performance insights** (which algorithm to use next time)

It's essentially a **sorting tool + benchmarking system** combined!
