# SMART SORTING SYSTEM (Python)

A **Smart Sorting System** developed in Python that intelligently sorts data using advanced divide-and-conquer algorithms. This project demonstrates algorithmic efficiency, performance comparison, benchmarking analysis, and structured problem-solving through the implementation of **Quick Sort (primary algorithm)** and **Merge Sort (alternate algorithm)**.

---

## Project Overview

The Smart Sorting System goes beyond basic sorting. Instead of relying on Python’s built-in sorting functions, this system:

- Implements custom sorting algorithms manually  
- Automatically benchmarks algorithm performance  
- Tracks execution time, comparisons, and memory usage  
- Generates a comparison report  
- Provides decision-making insights  

The system functions as both a **sorting tool** and a **performance analysis framework**.

## Algorithms Implemented

### 🔹 Quick Sort (Primary Algorithm)

Quick Sort serves as the main sorting engine of the system.

**Why Quick Sort?**
- Faster in real-world applications  
- Efficient for large datasets  
- Lower memory usage  
- Excellent average-case performance: **O(n log n)**  

**How Quick Sort Works:**
1. Selects a pivot element  
2. Partitions elements into smaller and larger groups  
3. Recursively sorts sub-arrays  

---

### 🔹 Merge Sort (Alternate Algorithm)

Merge Sort is implemented to provide guaranteed performance comparison and stability analysis.

**Why Merge Sort?**
- Guaranteed time complexity of **O(n log n)**  
- Stable sorting algorithm  
- Reliable for structured datasets  

**How Merge Sort Works:**
1. Divides the dataset into halves  
2. Recursively sorts each half  
3. Merges sorted halves into one sorted array
